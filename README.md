# introduction
A little about me!
Hello! My name is Audrey Woo and I am a Computer Science and Medieval Studies student at Fordham University!
My pronouns are She/They

As I start work on new projects, I will start uploading them here!

Current Projects:

D&D Character Generator: A Python practice project 

Combinatorics Nightmart RPG: What if Octopath Traveller was combined with Paper Mario Sticker Star? This game about applying runes to your weapons for fun effects! Will I include interactions between runes? Combinatorics says probably not.

Quantum Bogo Visual Novel: Get your heart broken, build a machine to prevent that from happening ever again. Meet the love of your life, fight entropic forces to be with them.
